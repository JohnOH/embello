# RFM69 radio driver

[code]: spi/rf69.fs (spi)
* Code: <a href="https://github.com/jeelabs/embello/tree/master/explore/1608-forth/flib/spi/rf69.fs">spi/rf69.fs</a>
* Needs: spi

This is a driver for the RFM69W and RFM69CW modules from HopeRF.

At the moment, all communication with the radio is polled, the interrupt signals
available on the DIO0..DIO5 pins are not used. Call `rf-recv` periodically to
find out whether a new packet has been received.

### API

[defs]: <> (rf-init rf-power rf-sleep)
```
: rf-init ( -- )  \ init RFM69 with current rf.group and rf.freq values
: rf-power ( n -- )  \ change TX power level (0..31)
: rf-sleep ( -- )  \ put radio module to sleep
```

[defs]: <> (rf-recv rf-send)
```
: rf-recv ( -- b )  \ check whether a packet has been received, return #bytes
: rf-send ( addr count hdr -- )  \ send out one packet
```

[defs]: <> (rf-listen rf-txtest rf.)
```
: rf-listen ( -- )  \ init RFM69 and report incoming packets until key press
: rf-txtest ( n -- )  \ send out a test packet with the number as ASCII chars
: rf. ( -- )  \ print out all the RF69 registers
```

### Variables

These should only be changed before calling `rf-init`:

[defs]: <> (rf.freq rf.group rf.nodeid)
```
8683 variable rf.freq    \ frequency (auto-scaled to 100..999 MHz)
  42 variable rf.group   \ network group (1..250)
  61 variable rf.nodeid  \ node ID of this node (1..63)
```

Information about the last packet reception:

[defs]: <> (rf.rssi rf.lna rf.afc rf.buf)
```
   0 variable rf.rssi  \ RSSI signal strength of last reception
   0 variable rf.lna   \ Low Noise Amplifier setting (set by AGC)
   0 variable rf.afc   \ Auto Frequency Control offset
  66 buffer:  rf.buf   \ buffer with last received packet data
```

### Examples

Listen for packets on 868.6 MHz, net group 6, and report each one in hex:

    8686 rf.freq !  \ set frequency, scaled down to 868.8 MHz
    6 rf.group !    \ set the net group to filter on to 6
    rf-listen       \ listen and print packets until RETURN typed

Sample output, this will continue until a key is typed on the console:

    RF69 21EE0675040006C00107 8102AA4A978080
    RF69 21EE0676040012C00107 8102A44A988080
    RF69 21EE0676040016C00104 81808080
    RF69 21EE067504000EC00107 8102A24A998080

Send a test packet with hex bytes 31 and 32 (the ASCII equivalent of "12"):

    12 rf-txtest  \ value is sent as ASCII-formatted payload

Put the RF module to sleep (it must have been initialised first):

    rf-sleep

To wake-up from sleep mode, call `rf-recv` or `rf-send`.

Display the radio's internal registers:

    rf.
