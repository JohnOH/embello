(this diagram is from an excellent page about the [Blue
Pill](http://wiki.stm32duino.com/index.php?title=Blue_Pill) on
[STM32duino](http://wiki.STM32duino.com))

The LED is on PC13, “0” is on.

### Known issues:

* There are several different variants of this board out in the wild, different
  colours, slightly different USB jack details (all Micro-USB), slightly
  different placement of the 2x3 BOOT0/BOOT1 jumper block.

Schematic: as [PDF](bluepill-schematic.pdf) (copied from the same STM32duino wiki as the diagram).
