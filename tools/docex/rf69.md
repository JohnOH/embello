# RFM69 radio driver

[code]: spi/rf69.fs (spi)

This is a driver for the RFM69W and RFM69CW modules from HopeRF.

At the moment, all communication with the radio is polled, the interrupt signals
available on the DIO0..DIO5 pins are not used. Call `rf-recv` periodically to
find out whether a new packet has been received.

### API

[defs]: <> (rf-init rf-power rf-sleep)

[defs]: <> (rf-recv rf-send)

[defs]: <> (rf-listen rf-txtest rf.)

### Variables

These should only be changed before calling `rf-init`:

[defs]: <> (rf.freq rf.group rf.nodeid)

Information about the last packet reception:

[defs]: <> (rf.rssi rf.lna rf.afc rf.buf)

### Examples

Listen for packets on 868.6 MHz, net group 6, and report each one in hex:
