**An exploration of Mecrisp-Stellaris Forth 2.2.1 on STM32F103 ÂµCs.**

This code runs on the "RF Node Watcher" hardware described on the [weblog][R].
The RNW includes an ARM-based [Hy-TinySTM103T][H], an RFM69 connected over SPI,
and a small 128x64 pixel OLED display connected over I2C. It should also work
on many other STM32F103 boards, see the "h" file for pin definitions.

> Note: there's currently no USB support, only serial @ 115200 baud on PA9 (TX)
and PA10 (RX) !

## Installation

The board must have Mecrisp-Stellaris Forth pre-loaded, see [SourceForge][F].
This 16 KB firmware provides a nice runtime environment, everything else here
has been implemented on top in pure Forth.

There are a few small "wrapper" files in this area, which include several more
substantial source files from `../flib/`:

* "h" will install a simple **H**ardware abstraction layer into flash memory
* "l" installs some **L**ibrary packages on top of "h", also in flash memory
* "d" is **D**evelopment and testing code which expects "h" and "l" in flash
* "a" is reserved for "sealed" ready-to-run **A**pplications (not used here)

(with Picocom, "^A ^S d" is very conveniently placed on the home row of keys)

Loading "h" will erase flash (everything but Mecrisp) before re-installing
itself. Similarly, loading "l" leaves Mecrisp and the "h" code intact, but
erases everything else before re-installing "l" (it then ends by loading "d").
Loading "d" is a RAM-only affair, allowing fast and frequent edit-run cycles.

The plan is to put everything deemed _essential_ in "h", while creating several
different versions of "d", depending on the application. In fact, the idea is
to have one folder with at least their own "l" and "d" files for each project.
All generic (or "official", if you prefer) code will be placed in "`../flib/`".
A completely sealed & ready-to-run application should be saved as an "a" file.

In day-to-day use, "h" and "l" get loaded once and then remain on the chip,
ready for use after power-up. This creates a fairly elaborate context for
development, including bit-banged SPI and I2C drivers, as well as the OLED
and RF69 drivers. There is a complete graphics library, able to draw lines,
circles, and text, plus a logo bitmap and an ASCII 8x8 text font.

Flash memory use is well under 32 KB for all of the above plus Mecrisp Forth.

New code and definitions can be typed in interactively, or added to "d" and
reloaded. Once the code is stable enough, it can then be moved to a new source
file and included in "l" to make it more permanent.
