Pico Reflow Controller, based on HyTiny w/ STM32F103TB, 128K flash.

    PA1 = on-board LED & FAN PWM out
    PA2 = heater voltage, ADC in
    PA3 = power level, ADC in
    PA4 = SSEL, RFM69CW
    PA5 = SCLK, RFM69CW
    PA6 = MISO, RFM69CW
    PA7 = MOSI, RFM69CW
    PA8 = PT100 power, out
    PA15 = IRQ, RFM69CW

    PB0 = PT100 sensor, ADC in
    PB1 = heater control, PWM out
    PB2 = BOOT1, buzzer, out
    PB3 = cover microswitch
    PB4 = black button, in
    PB5 = white button, in
    PB6 = SCL, OLED
    PB7 = SDA, OLED

    PA9+PA10 = serial
    PA0+PA11+PA12 = USB
    PA13+PA14 = SWD
